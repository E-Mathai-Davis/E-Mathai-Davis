#AM Radio Board

Description: 
 - Practice design with KiCad
 - Analog AM superheterodyne reciever designed as general use AM radio
 - Still in revision

My goal for this board was to familiarize myself with more Analog Signal Processing techniques. I wanted to familiarize myself with RLC filters, as well as active filters. The files in this repository are entirely EDA files and drawings.
