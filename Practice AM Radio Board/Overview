#AM Radio Board

Description: 
 - Practice design with KiCad
 - Analog AM superheterodyne reciever designed as general use AM radio
 - Still in revision

My goal for this board was to familiarize myself with more Electrical Engineering mathematics through the use of a project. I tuned the values of the various passives on the board by calculating their impedance values and adjusting them to match the AM frequencies.
DISCLAIMER: I am still in the process of obtaining a HAM radio license, so this is a concept design, not a finalized design.
