# Welcome!
## Ethan Mathai - University of California, Davis - Electrical Engineering
Hello, I am Ethan Mathai, an undergraduate student, researcher, and technology enthusiast. I am always on the lookout for exciting electronics and systems, and I hope to be part of a movement to bring change in tech through innovation. Here, I am catalogging my most recent works for public viewing.

I am fascinated by the realm of electronics. I aim to step into the field of photonics, telecommunications, digital and analog systems, and wireless connections, as well as many other areas within Electrical Engineering. Some of the projects I have worked on will be posted here.

I also aim to apply my understandings of electronics and physics in the realm of Machine Leanring and AI. I believe my intuition as an engineer with a wide background of experiences allows me to be equipped to bring great innovation to this field. Therefore, I test my understanding with projects that adapt ideas from physics and apply it to these fields directly.
